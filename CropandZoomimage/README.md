# [Crop and Zoom Image in JSP]

We were finding a jQuery demo for one of project to crop and zoom image before we upload it to Java server.
We found so many demos working with php but didn't get with JSP or Servlet. 
So We developed this simple demo to crop an image and upload it to server via servlet - Jsp.
This demo is developed in Netbeans IDE 8.0.1.

A simple jQuery image cropping plugin is developed by Fengyuan Chen. We've just edited jQuery as per our requirements. 
You can also see his complete demo on..

# Main

```
css
├── cropper.css     

js
├── cropper.js      
└── docs.js
```
img
├── picture-1.jpg
your uploaded images will be stored here.. 

# Getting started

## Installation

Include files:

```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script><!-- jQuery is required -->
<link  href="/path/to/cropper.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/path/to/cropper.js"></script>
```


## Usage

Initialize with `$.fn.cropper` method.

```html
<!-- Wrap the image or canvas with a block element -->
<div class="container">
  <img src="picture.jpg">
</div>
```

```javascript
$(".container > img").cropper({
  aspectRatio: 1,
  done: function(data) {
    // Crop image with the result data.
  }
});
```

**Notes:**
- The size of the cropper inherits from the size of the image's parent element, 
so be sure to wrap the image with a visible block element.
- The values of the result data was computed with the original size of the image, 
so you can use them to crop the image directly.


#### aspectRatio

- type: `String` | `Number`
- default: `1`

The aspect ratio of the cropping zone.
By default, the cropping zone is free ratio.


By default, the cropping zone will appear in the center of the image.

For example:

#### preview

To see the preview click on 'Crop Image to Preview'

## Methods

#### zoom

- Zoom the image.
- Param: a number (positive number for zoom in, negative number for zoom out).
- Usage: `$().cropper("zoom", 0.1)` or `$().cropper("zoom", -0.1)`.
- Use: buttons or mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out.


#### rotate

- Rotate the image (Replace the original image with a new rotated image which was generated by canvas).
- Param: a number (positive number for rotate right, negative number for rotate left).
- Usage: `$().cropper("rotate", 90)` or `$().cropper("rotate", -90)`.
- Note: Be sure the browser supports canvas before call this method.


#### reset

- Reset the cropping zone to the start state.
- Add a `true` param to reset the cropping zone to the default state.
- Usage: `$().cropper("reset")` or `$().cropper("reset", true)`.

## Events of jQuery Plugin

This event will be fired when the Cropper starts to build.


#### built.cropper

This event will be fired after the cropping zone stop to move.

Related events: "mouseup", "mouseleave", "touchend", "touchleave", "touchcancel".

## No conflict

If you have to use other plugin with the same namespace, just call the `$.fn.cropper.noConflict` method to revert to it.

```
<script src="other-plugin.js"></script>
<script src="cropper.js"></script>
<script>
$.fn.cropper.noConflict();
// Code that uses other plugin's "$().cropper" can follow here.
</script>
```
## Browser Support

- Chrome 36+
- Firefox 31+
- Internet Explorer 8+
- Opera 21+
- Safari 5.1+

As a jQuery plugin, you can reference to the [jQuery Browser Support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/).


##Java:

By clicking on 'Save Image' the form will be submitted to 'Upload' servlet.

#Upload Servlet:

It will take get the encoded image i.e. in Base64 string, and will convert Base64 String into an image file and store it into 'img' folder.
That String is sent to an another JSP page (CroppedImage) via session to show the cropped image.
Here Upload directory is to be set by yourself (static).

#CroppedImage.jsp:

Simply gets the value of session attribute and displays cropped image.
